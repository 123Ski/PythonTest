Project Title
Data Preprocessing with Pandas: A Hands-On Lab

Short Description:

This lab provides a comprehensive guide on using Python's pandas library for preprocessing datasets. It covers essential methods and functions for cleaning and formatting data, ensuring that it is ready for analysis and modeling.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python

pandas library

Running the Tests

Breakdown of Tests

Check DataFrame Shape:

Verify the number of records and columns in the DataFrame.

df.shape
Check DataFrame Size:

Determine the total number of elements in the DataFrame.

df.size
Display Column Names:

Retrieve the names of columns in the DataFrame.

df.columns
Check Column Data Types:

Examine the data types of each column in the DataFrame.

df.dtypes
Check Specific Column Type:

Confirm the data type of a specific column (e.g., 'phd').
df.phd.dtype
Data Cleaning:

Ensure correct data formats by checking and converting data types.
df.info()

Deployment


This lab serves as a foundational guide for data preprocessing using pandas. Apply the knowledge gained to real-world datasets to enhance data quality for downstream analysis and machine learning tasks.
